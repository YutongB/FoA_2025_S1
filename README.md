Hello world! 

Welcome to FoA 2025 Sem 1!

I plan to update these notes throughout the semester so that they might be useful to you for the exam.

Please note that these are supplementary (unofficial) materials, and should not be used in place of the textbook, lecture slides, workshop solutions in obtaining authoritative information on what will be assessed. They should only be used to assist in your understanding of material covered in the other formats.

There are some code taken from Programming, Problem Solving, and Abstraction with C by Alistair Moffat (revised edition, Pearson, 2012). The slides are modified from slides created by **Liam Saliba** for FoA 2020-2023.

Hopefully there are no unintentional mistakes (the intentional ones are noted), if you find any, please let me know.
